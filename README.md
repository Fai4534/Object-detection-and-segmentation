# ðŸ§ª Detection and Segmentation of Zones of Inhibition using Detectron2

This project uses Detectron2 to detect and segment zones of inhibition in antibiogram test images. These zones indicate the effectiveness of antibiotics against bacterial growth. Automating this process supports faster and more consistent diagnostic decisions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Objective

Antibiograms are used by clinicians to monitor local antibiotic resistance patterns. During lab testing, antibiotics are applied to bacterial cultures, and zones of inhibitionâ€”areas with no bacterial growthâ€”are measured to determine susceptibility. This project automates the detection and measurement of these zones using image detection and segmentation.
