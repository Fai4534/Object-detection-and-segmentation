This project uses Detectron2, a state-of-the-art deep learning framework for object detection and segmentation, to automatically detect and segment zones of inhibition in antibiogram test images. These zones help clinicians evaluate antibiotic effectiveness.

The workflow includes:

Dataset setup (images + COCO-style annotations)
Detectron2 model training
Model inference on test images
Visualization of bounding boxes and masks
Modularized code for reuse and clarity

The project is divided into multiple folders: input data, source code, trained model output, and notebooks for training and inference.
